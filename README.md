## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ts-node-api.git
   cd ts-node-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_url
   PORT=your_jwt_secret
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_jwt_secret
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_jwt_secret
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_EXPIRE_IN=your_jwt_secret
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET_EXPIRE_IN=your_jwt_secret
   ```

## Usage

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To start the built application:

```bash
npm start
```

For running Prisma migrations and seeding your database, execute:

```bash
npx ts-node ./src/prisma.ts
```

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the application in production mode.
- `npm run dev`: Runs the application in development mode using Nodemon.
- `npm run devSql`: Runs the Prisma setup and database migrations.
- `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript.

## API Endpoints

The application provides various API endpoints to manage products and users. Here are some examples:

- **POST /api/auth/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/auth/login**: Authenticate a user and return a JWT.
- **GET /api/products**: Retrieve all products.
- **POST /api/products**: Add a new product (requires authentication).

Check the code in the `src/routes` directory for more details on the available endpoints and their functionality.
